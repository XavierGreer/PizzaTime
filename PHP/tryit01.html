<h1>Welcome to EM420's Supernatural Extravaganza!</h1>
<p>As you might guess, I'm not a completely serious kind of instructor.  This is a creative class, use that Freedom!  In this course we will build dynamic web pages using a SQL database to populate information.  This Index page is a way to help organize the work we're doing so that we can find examples and show our progress.  Since I'm a 'bit' of a <i>Supernatural</i> fan, here's my demo page :) I bet you can't guess what my Store will be about ...

 <td><p><h2>Bio: T'Chris Gardner</h2><p>I'm an all 'round swell guy, loved by millions (of bacteria at least).  I have been teaching at CTU for the better part of 17 years.  I teach the Capstone courses for CS and IT majors where we design, build, and deploy something every two semesters.  It's a great, hands-on kind of course.  So is this one :)<br>
In my regular life, I'm a Software Quality Assurance guy working for <a href="http://transfirst.com" target="_new">TransFirst</a>.  I've been in the technology fields for over 20 years and remember owning a Vic-20 buying my first home computer (a Machintosh SE) and being shocked the salesman wanted me to purchase a "useless" add-on called a hard drive.  Today I own much cooler equipment!<br>
As you might guess, I really like science fiction, machinery, brewing, flying, and a variety of other things.  Ask :)  </p>
<p>While my original degree is in theatre, I now have a Masters in Systems Engineering and in Computer Sciience.  And <i>soon</i>, say 2065, I'll have a Doctorate, too.  I'm a Doctoral candidate working on how we'll <a href="http:futureoftesting.net" target="_new">test our Robot Overlords</a> when we start building them.  <br></td>
